# Open Source Research Proposal: Cross-Pollination of Communication Strategies Between Parkinson's Disease and Non-Speaking Autism

## Executive Summary

This proposal explores the untapped potential of applying communication strategies developed for non-speaking autistic individuals to Parkinson's disease patients experiencing speech loss. Despite different etiologies, both conditions involve motor planning disruptions in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits, suggesting that interventions successful in autism may benefit Parkinson's patients.

## Background and Rationale

### The Parallel Problem
- **Parkinson's Disease**: Progressive loss of speech affecting 89% of patients, from hypophonia to complete mutism
- **Non-speaking Autism**: 25-30% of autistic individuals are minimally speaking or non-speaking despite intact cognition

### Shared Neurological Features
Both conditions involve:
- Basal ganglia dysfunction affecting motor initiation and sequencing
- Preserved receptive language with impaired expressive output
- Apraxia of speech (motor planning disruption)
- Better automatic/emotional speech than volitional speech
- Response to external cueing and rhythm

### The Knowledge Gap
The autism community has 40+ years of AAC development and motor planning interventions, while Parkinson's speech therapy primarily focuses on volume (LSVT LOUD) and articulation. This represents a massive untapped resource.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Systematic review** of communication interventions successful in non-speaking autism applicable to Parkinson's
2. **Pilot testing** of autism-developed AAC strategies in Parkinson's patients
3. **Development** of hybrid intervention protocol combining both fields' expertise

### Secondary Objectives
1. Identify biomarkers predicting intervention response
2. Create open-source AAC tools optimized for Parkinson's motor symptoms
3. Establish timeline for introducing alternative communication methods

## Proposed Studies

### Study 1: Intervention Mapping and Feasibility
**Design**: Mixed methods feasibility study  
**Participants**: 30 PD patients with speech difficulties, 10 SLPs, 10 autism communication specialists  
**Duration**: 6 months

**Methods**:
- Map successful autism interventions to Parkinson's symptoms
- Test acceptability and feasibility
- Measure communication effectiveness

**Outcomes**:
- Feasibility metrics (recruitment, retention, adherence)
- Communication Effectiveness Scale scores
- Quality of life measures
- Caregiver burden assessment

### Study 2: Comparative Effectiveness Trial
**Design**: Randomized controlled trial  
**Participants**: 120 PD patients  
**Arms**: 
1. Standard speech therapy (LSVT LOUD)
2. Autism-adapted AAC protocol
3. Combined approach
4. Waitlist control

**Duration**: 12 months intervention + 6 months follow-up

**Primary Outcome**: Communication Participation Item Bank scores  
**Secondary Outcomes**: 
- Speech intelligibility
- Communication frequency
- Caregiver-reported communication success
- Technology adoption rates

### Study 3: Predictive Biomarker Study
**Design**: Prospective cohort with neuroimaging  
**Participants**: 60 PD patients across disease stages  

**Assessments**:
- Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (locus coeruleus integrity)
- DTI (white matter tract integrity)
- Resting-state fMRI (network connectivity)
- Genetic markers (LRRK2, GBA, SNCA)
- Speech motor testing battery

**Analysis**: Machine learning to predict intervention response

### Study 4: Technology Development Sprint
**Design**: Participatory design with iterative development  
**Participants**: 20 PD patients, 20 non-speaking autistics, caregivers, developers  

**Deliverables**:
- Open-source AAC app optimized for Parkinson's
- Predictive text algorithm trained on PD communication patterns
- Sensor-based speech initiation support system
- Eye-tracking communication interface for advanced disease

## Innovative Methods from Autism Research to Test

### Motor Planning Interventions
1. **PROMPT** (Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets): Tactile-kinesthetic approach
2. **RPM** (Rapid Prompting Method): Adapted for Parkinson's motor limitations
3. **Spelling to Communicate**: Letter board progression

### Technology Adaptations
1. **Partner-assisted scanning**: Adapted for Parkinson's tremor
2. **Switch timing optimization**: Accounting for bradykinesia
3. **Predictive language models**: Trained on Parkinson's speech patterns
4. **Multimodal communication**: Gesture + partial speech + text

### Sensory-Motor Bridging
1. Vibrotactile feedback for speech initiation
2. Rhythmic entrainment protocols
3. Music-assisted speech training
4. Proprioceptive cueing strategies
